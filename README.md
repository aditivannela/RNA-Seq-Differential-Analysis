# RNA-Seq-Differential-Analysis
This project performs of differential analysis of RNA-sequencing data from mouse bone marrow derived macrophages pretreated with a KAT8 inhibitor and stimulated with R848. The purpose of this analysis is to identify genes that are expressed or repressed when KAT8 is inhibited during TLR7/8 stimulation.
